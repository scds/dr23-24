# Building JavaScript Websites 1: Styling Modern Web Apps

Are you building your own web site using JavaScript and frameworks? In this first workshop of the Building JavaScript Websites series, learn to apply consistent design standards to a JavaScript web site.

Starting from a simple prepared single-page application, we will walk you through how to apply consistent theme styling, using McMaster Branding guidelines as an example. Each workshop in this series can be taken independently of the other workshops in the series.

**The materials for this workshop are available here:** <https://mcmasterrs.github.io/ws_web-design-guide/>
