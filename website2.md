# Building JavaScript Websites 2: Designing for Mobile UI

Are you building your own web site using JavaScript and frameworks? In this second workshop of the Building JavaScript Websites series, learn to design your web site to work for desktop and mobile sized screens.

Starting from a simple prepared single-page application, we will walk you through how to scale your web site to work with the small screens on mobile devices without any loss of functionality. Each workshop in this series can be taken independently of the other workshops in the series.

**The materials for this workshop are available here:** <https://mcmasterrs.github.io/ws_web-design-guide/>
